Bons Web Developer Challenge 

This landing was build with next.js in order to use React components to make a static layout.
First, run "npm run start", to create the node_modules.
If you want to run it in your server, please run "npm run dev" in the shell.
If you want to build it for production, please run "npm run build" and then "npm run export".
The exported files will be in the /out directory.
You need node.js and npm already installed.
For the css, styled jsx was used, to make the css the more isollated posibly.
Sadly, I ran out of time so responsive views were not made.

Thanks.
Florencia.
