      TED is a nonpartisan nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks. TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics from science to business to global issues â€” in more than 110 languages. Meanwhile, independently run TEDx events help share ideas in communities around the world.
